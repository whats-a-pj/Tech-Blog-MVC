## Description

This is a handlebars tech blog built from scratch! Users can sign up and login to create posts on their home page! This assignment definitely had me biting off more than i could chew, its a BEAST. Sign in, go to your dashboard and you can create a post there that will show up on your homepage. Still working out the bugs but as of right now it is receiving MOST data. Just not completely able to Update or Delete yet.

These were the websites that I used to help me understand how to complete this project:

I also had help from AskBCS and a few TA's but it's still not quite there yet, my data is saving but its not saving right away. I tried console logging to help find the broken piece but as of right now, users can log in, sign up, create a post, but the post will take a while to render on the homepage unfortunately.
